Scrutinizer API
===============

This is a quick getting started for using the Scrutinizer API. As your starting to learn about what type of JSON to pass to the API it is helpful to look at the ':ref:`scrutinizer_image` ' tab found within any Scrutinzier report. To get to this simply click 'Filters/Details' and navigate to the tab.
